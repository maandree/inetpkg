What inetpkg is *not*:

  * A package manager

  * A replace for package management

  * Something I propose we use


What inetpkg *is*:

  * A specification for distro-agnostic packages

  * An augmentation to existing package managers

  * Usable without a package manager

  * A draft proposal to how we should solve the
    problem of "distributing end-user applications"
    under the assumption that there is work to
    be done in this area

  * Dependant only on software everyone already
    have installed


Goals:

  * Distro-agnostic and universal

  * Functional on even the most minimal
    GNU/Linux distributions

  * Supplement to rather than complement to
    or replacement of existing package managers

  * Stupid-simple

  * Functional without support from the
    distribution, but better, through tie-in,
    if supported

  * User-private package installation, only

  * Usable by even the most foolish user
    (Is that not why we need this in the
    first place?)
